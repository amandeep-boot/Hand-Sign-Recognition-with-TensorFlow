# Hand-Sign-Recognition-with-TensorFlow
Hand Sign Recognition with TensorFlow is a real-time ASL gesture recognition tool. Trained on the ASL Alphabet dataset, it uses a deep learning model to classify ASL signs from a live webcam feed. The project integrates TensorFlow for model processing and OpenCV for video capture, ideal for accessibility and learning apps.
